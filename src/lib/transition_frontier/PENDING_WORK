- audit persistent root state management (updates, resets)
+ hook up transition registry
* add unit tests back in
- diff buffer flush on interval
- invert broadcastable extensions functor (include functor in definition, don't pass definition to functor)
- transition frontier graceful shutdown
- create reusable pattern for singleton factories
- singleton factory instance reuse after destruction prevention
- improved error handling in persistent frontier instance entrypoints
- improved persistent frontier database batched requests
- convert persistent frontier sync into an extension?
- extensions full diffs
- extensions refactor (multiple files)
- dynamic extensions? (probably just open an issue for this)
