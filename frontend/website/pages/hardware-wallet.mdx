# Hardware wallets

Coda now supports the usage of hardware wallets such as Ledger to interact with the protocol, and sign transactions.

## Requirements

**Software**: Linux (currently supports Debian 9 and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS)

Note: macOS and Windows are not officially supported at this time.

**Hardware**: Currently only `Ledger Nano S` is supported

## Installation

**Disclaimer**: This is highly experimental now. Once the hardware wallet app is available on `Ledger Live`, the installation would be much eaiser.

The following debian packages are needed to use hardware wallets on linux:
```
sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev1 libudev-dev
```

The coda hardware wallet command line tool is a python package called `coda-ledger-cli`:
```
python3 -mpip install coda-ledger-cli 
```

If you have connection issues with your hardware wallet, please take a look at [the troubleshooting help on the Ledger support page](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005165269-Fix-connection-issues).
Oftentimes, connectivity issues can be resolved by adding udev rules. Enter the following command to automatically add the rules and reload udev:
```
wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LedgerHQ/udev-rules/master/add_udev_rules.sh | sudo bash
```

## Create a new account using the hardware wallet

Run the following command which will create a public and private keypair in the hardware wallet:

    coda accounts create-hd HD-index

HD-index is a number that works like a seed that you give to the hardware wallet to create your public and private keypair. If you use the same HD-index with the same hardware wallet twice, then public and private keypair that gets generated is the same. If you need to use the same account on another machine, then you just need to use this command with the same HD-index and the same hardware wallet.

During account creation, your hardware wallet may ask you to confirm the operation.

The response from this command will look like this:

    Keypair generated
    Public key:  4vsRCVbLm6LvUyzYWT95WaCzyi4D4UHxRpLBhMn7q2mRPgNCgRG3Jr3tDuhgQdmzbvCcBxhUwB3REpY2Dyf1NAxSSs8Q2vdJX93pT7eyqcyRU2S9UpDddDgovj46BSknNjzydKoopebp5Kva

Since the public key is quite long and difficult to remember, let's save it as an environment variable:

    export CODA_PUBLIC_KEY=<YOUR-PUBLIC-KEY>

Now we can access this everywhere as `$CODA_PUBLIC_KEY` -- see if it saved properly by trying `echo $CODA_PUBLIC_KEY`.

## Make a payment

Sending a payment with a hardware wallet is almost the same as send a payment from an ordinary account.

There are only 2 differences:
1. You do not need to unlock your account before sending the transaction because your account is protected by your hardware wallet already.
2. Your hardware wallet may ask you to confirm the operation while signing the transaction.

You can simply use the same commands to send payments found in [the docs](/docs/my-first-transaction/).

## Troubleshooting

### What if I lose my hardware wallet?
You can buy another `Ledger Nano S` and initialize it with the same 24-word seed to gain access to your existing account.

### What if I forget the public key of my account?
If you remember the HD-index which you use to generate your account, then you can use `coda accounts create-hd HD-index` with the same HD-index to regenerate the public_key.
