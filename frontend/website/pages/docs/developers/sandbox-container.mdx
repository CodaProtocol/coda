# Sandbox Container

If all you need is a running daemon and some blocks, the sandbox container has everything you need! It uses the same configuration as the testnet, but instead of the community participants ledger it uses a simple ledger with a single demo account.

This can be useful for testing or playing with some of the core features of the protocol.  This node supports multiple accounts, sending transactions between them, and will also support delegating and staking. In fact since it's a single node network, you'll get all the block rewards!

<Alert>

This container will **NOT** connect you to the live network.

## Installation

In order to use the demo container, you'll need to install Docker, the simplest way will be to use [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

After you have Docker installed run the following command to spin up the container.

```
docker run --publish 3085:3085 -it \
  codaprotocol/coda-demo:0.0.12-beta-demo-mode-sync-status-a6de071
```

This command will start a daemon inside the docker container and expose the GraphQL port (3085), which is used for communication with the client, to your computer. This daemon will automatically be running a block producer and snark worker.

### Account details

The container has one account with this public key:

```
4vsRCVMNTrCx4NpN6kKTkFKLcFN4vXUP5RB9PqSZe1qsyDs4AW5XeNgAf16WUPRBCakaPiXcxjp6JUpGNQ6fdU977x5LntvxrSg11xrmK6ZDaGSMEGj12dkeEpyKcEpkzcKwYWZ2Yf2vpwQP
```

The password for this account is the empty string (there's no password -- you can leave the password field blank).

## How to use the sandbox

There are a few things you can do with your sandbox now that you have it running:

- [Install Coda](/docs/getting-started#installation) as usual and use many of the client commands. Since the daemon is already running in the container, you don't need to run `coda daemon`!

- Install the [GUI Wallet]() app to use a graphical interface to your node. Enter '127.0.0.1' as the host of your node during setup.

- Head over to https://localhost:3085/graphql to play with the GraphQL API directly.
