# My First Transaction

In this section, we'll make our first transaction on the Coda network. After [installing the software](../getting-started), we'll need to create a new account before we can send or receive coda. Let's first start up the node so that we can start issuing commands.

## Start up a node

Run the following command to start up a Coda node instance and connect to the network:

    coda daemon \
        -external-port 8302 \
        -discovery-port 8303 \
        -peer /dns4/seed-one.genesis.o1test.net/tcp/10002/ipfs/12D3KooWP7fTKbyiUcYJGajQDpCFo2rDexgTHFJTxCH8jvcL1eAH \
        -peer /dns4/seed-two.genesis.o1test.net/tcp/10002/ipfs/12D3KooWL9ywbiXNfMBqnUKHSB1Q1BaHFNUzppu6JLMVn9TTPFSA

The host and port specified above refer to the seed peer address - this is the initial peer we will connect to on the network. Since Coda is a [peer-to-peer](../glossary/#peer-to-peer) protocol, there is no single centralized server we rely on. 

If you forwarded custom ports (other than 8302 and 8303), you'll need to replace the default ports above with the ones you forwarded.

<Alert>

  The daemon process needs to be running whenever you issue commands from `coda client`, so make sure you don't kill it by accident.

</Alert>

See [here](/docs/troubleshooting/) for common issues when first running a node.

## Checking connectivity

Now that we've started up a node and are running the Coda daemon, open up another shell and run the following command:

    coda client status

<Alert>

  For now, it may take up to a minute before `coda client status` connects to the daemon when first starting up. So if you see `Error: daemon not running. See coda daemon`, just a wait a bit and try again.

</Alert>

Most likely we will see a response that include the fields below:

    ...
    Peers:                                         Total: 4 (...)
    ...
    Sync Status:                                   Bootstrap

If you see `Sync Status: Bootstrap`, this means that the Coda node is bootstrapping and needs to sync with the rest of the network. You may need to be patient here as this step might take some time for the node to get all the data it needs. When sync status reaches `Synced` and the node is connected to 1 or more peers, we will have successfully connected to the network.


## Create a new account

Once our node is synced, we'll create a public/private key-pair so that we can sign transactions and generate an address to receive payments. For security reasons, we'll want to put the keys under a directory that is harder for attackers to access.

Run either one of the following commands which will create a public and private key `my-wallet` and `my-wallet.pub` under the `keys` directory:

    coda client-old generate-keypair -privkey-path keys/my-wallet 
  
    coda accounts create

    
If you are running the node on a cloud virtual machine, make sure to copy your generated private key file to your local machine. You can do this with the command `scp <source> <destination>`. In the case that your machine shuts down, you will need to import the private key file using the following command and flag: 

    coda accounts import -privkey-path <INSERT FILE PATH HERE> 

You may also run the command `coda accounts -help` to learn more about how to use the command. 
    
<Alert kind="warning">

  The public key can be shared freely with anyone, but be very careful with your private key file. Never share this private key with anyone, as it is the equivalent of a password for your funds.

</Alert>

The response from this command will look like this:

    Keypair generated
    Public key:  4vsRCVbLm6LvUyzYWT95WaCzyi4D4UHxRpLBhMn7q2mRPgNCgRG3Jr3tDuhgQdmzbvCcBxhUwB3REpY2Dyf1NAxSSs8Q2vdJX93pT7eyqcyRU2S9UpDddDgovj46BSknNjzydKoopebp5Kva

Since the public key is quite long and difficult to remember, let's save it as an environment variable:

    export CODA_PK=<public-key>

Now we can access this everywhere as `$CODA_PK`. Note that this will only be saved for the current shell session, so if you want to save it for future use, you can add it to your `~/.profile` or `~/.bash_profile`.

## Request coda

In order to send our first transaction, we'll first need to get some coda to play with. Head over to the [Coda Discord server](https://bit.ly/CodaDiscord) and join the `#faucet` channel. Once there, ask Tiny the dog for some coda (you'll receive 100). Here's an example:

    $request <public-key>

Once a faucet-mod thumbs up your request, keep an eye on the Discord channel to see when the transaction goes through on that side. It may take a few minutes for your funds to appear.

Sometimes Tiny goes to sleep or isn't feeling well. In that case, ask a fellow community member in the `#faucet` on Discord to send you some tokens!

We can check our balance to make sure that we received the funds by running the following command, passing in our public key:

    coda client get-balance -public-key $CODA_PUBLIC_KEY

You might see `No account found at that public_key (zero balance)`. Be patient! Depending on the traffic in the network, it may take a few blocks before your transaction goes through.

While you're waiting take a look at your daemon logs for new blocks being generated. Run the following command to see the current block height:

    coda client status

## Make a payment

Finally we get to the good stuff, sending our first transaction! Before you send a payment, you'll need to unlock your account. You can do so with:

    coda accounts unlock -public-key $CODA_PUBLIC_KEY

For testing purposes, there's already an [echo service](https://github.com/CodaProtocol/coda-automation/tree/master/services/echo) set up that will immediately refund your payment minus the transaction fees.

<Alert kind="warning">

  Currently, there is a known issue with the echo service that prevents it from properly echoing back your payment! Don't worry, we'll still give you Testnet Points[\*](#disclaimer) for completing the challenge.

</Alert>

Let's send some of our newly received coda to this service to see what a payment looks like:

    coda client send-payment \
      -amount 10 \
      -receiver 4vsRCVNep7JaFhtySu6vZCjnArvoAhkRscTy5TQsGTsKM4tJcYVc3uNUMRxQZAwVzSvkHDGWBmvhFpmCeiPASGnByXqvKzmHt4aR5uAWAQf3kqhwDJ2ZY3Hw4Dzo6awnJkxY338GEp12LE4x \
      -fee 5 \
      -sender $YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY

If you're wondering what we passed in to the commands above:

- For `amount`, we're sending a test value of `10` coda
- The `receiver` is the public key of the [echo service](https://github.com/CodaProtocol/coda-automation/tree/master/services/echo)
- For `fee`, let's use the current market rate of `5` coda
- The `sender` is the full public key located in `*.pub` ex. `4vsRCVNep7JaFhtySu6vZCjnArvoAhkRscTy5TQsGTsKM4tJcYVc3uNUMRxQZAwVzSvkHDGWBmvhFpmCeiPASGnByXqvKzmHt4aR5uAWAQf3kqhwDJ2ZY3Hw4Dzo6awnJkxY338GEp12LE4x`

If this command is formatted properly, we should get a response that looks like the following:

    Dispatched payment with ID 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

## Check account balance

Now that we can send transactions, it might be helpful to know our balance, so that we don't spend our testnet tokens too carelessly! Let's check our current balance by running the following command, passing in the public key of the account we generated:

    coda client get-balance -public-key $CODA_PK

We'll get a response that looks like this:

    Balance: 50 coda

Once you feel comfortable with the basics of creating an address, and sending & receiving coda, we can move on to the truly unique parts of the Coda network - [participating in consensus and helping compress the blockchain](/docs/node-operator).
