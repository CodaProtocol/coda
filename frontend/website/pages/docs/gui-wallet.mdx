The GUI Wallet is the easiest way to connect to the Coda network and run a node. You can use the wallet to send transactions, check your funds, and create zk-SNARKs to compress transactions.

## Installation

The Wallet needs to connect to a daemon in order to work, but you will be guided through the proceses of setting up a node when you first launch the wallet. If you already are running a node, you can use that one.

Alternatively, if you already have a node running, the wallet will notice and connect to that running Coda node.

### MacOS

[Download the latest build here](https://github.com/CodaProtocol/coda/releases/download/0.1.1-wallet-compat-0.0.11-beta/Coda.Wallet.0.1.1.dmg)

Open the DMG file and drag the wallet into your Applications folder. 

The first time you run the wallet you will see this screeen...

Insert here.

Do not worry!! This is okay, just go to settings and open Security Preferences, then click "Allow" then open Coda and it should start fine.

### Linux

[Download the latest build here](https://github.com/CodaProtocol/coda/releases/download/0.1.1-wallet-compat-0.0.11-beta/Coda.Wallet.0.1.1.AppImage)

2. `chmod +x` the file
3. Run the appimage in a terminal

## Setup

<Alert>

Temporarily for Phase 3.2 please use the Docker demo container until we are able to fix the network. Follow the [steps here](/docs/getting-started#docker).

</Alert>

When you open the Wallet for the first time you'll be guided through a few steps to setup your node, create an account and begin using Coda. 

If you get stuck on anything head over to [Discord](https://bit.ly/CodaDiscord) and ask for help in the #product channel.
