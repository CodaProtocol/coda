**Coda Genesis Program**
**Program Details**

Current


1. Genesis founding members will be required to participate as block producers on mainnet by staking all tokens received for a continuous period of one year starting on mainnet launch. **Members who do not stake all of their tokens for the duration of the 1 year staking period will forfeit their entire distribution of tokens.**
2. Distributions will be locked up for four years after mainnet launch. During this time, locked tokens will not be able to be transferred. After the first year, one quarter of tokens will become unlocked. The rest will become unlocked in equal monthly tranches over the following three years. Additional tokens that members earn as staking rewards will not be locked up or subject to any restrictions.

Proposed



1. All tokens distributed under the Genesis program (from Cohort 2 onwards*) will be subject to a 4 year vesting period starting at mainnet launch. During the vesting period, you must participate as a block producer, by staking or delegating all of your unvested tokens. **If you stop staking or delegating at any time during the vesting period, you risk forfeiting all unvested tokens.** 
2. 25% of your tokens will vest on the one year anniversary of mainnet launch, with the remaining tokens vesting in equal monthly tranches over the following three years. Additional tokens earned as a reward for staking or delegating are not subject to any restrictions.

    *Note: Cohort 1 has a 1-year staking period

**Terms and Conditions**

Current



1. If you receive a distribution, you must stake or delegate your entire distribution for a continuous period of 1 year commencing on the day of Coda Protocol’s mainnet genesis block (“Staking Period”). **IF YOU DO NOT STAKE OR DELEGATE THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF YOUR DISTRIBUTION FOR THE DURATION OF THE STAKING PERIOD THEN YOU WILL FORFEIT YOUR ENTIRE DISTRIBUTION.**
2. During the Staking Period, forfeiture will be enforced automatically at the protocol level. This means that if you fail to meet the staking requirement, Coda Protocol will automatically enforce the forfeiture of your tokens, which will be irreversible and not subject to dispute. O(1) Labs will not be able to prevent forfeiture from being enforced by Coda Protocol and will not compensate you in the event that your tokens are forfeited.
3. At the end of the Staking Period, provided that you have met the staking requirements, your tokens will no longer be subject to forfeiture. However your tokens will still be subject to lock-up as follows.
4. At the end of the Staking Period, one-quarter of your coda tokens will be fully released from lock-up. Those tokens will be immediately available to you, with no further restrictions on transfer or sale. The remaining three quarters of the tokens will be subject to a further 3 year lock-up period (“Lock-up Period”) commencing at the end of the Staking Period.

Proposed



1. All tokens distributed under the Genesis program, for Cohort 2 and all following Cohorts, will be subject to a 4 year vesting period commencing on the day of Coda Protocol’s mainnet genesis block (“Vesting Period”). 
2. **IF YOU DO NOT STAKE OR DELEGATE ALL UNVESTED TOKENS FOR THE DURATION OF THE VESTING PERIOD THEN YOU RISK FORFEITING ANY UNVESTED TOKENS.**
3. One-quarter of your tokens from the Genesis program will vest on the first anniversary of mainnet launch. The remaining tokens will vest in equal monthly tranches over the following three years. 
4. Forfeiture may be enforced automatically at the protocol level. This means that if you fail to stake or delegate at any time during the Vesting Period, the protocol will automatically enforce the forfeiture of all of your unvested tokens, which will be irreversible and not subject to dispute. O(1) Labs may not be able to prevent forfeiture from being enforced by the protocol and will not compensate you in the event that your tokens are forfeited.
5. Vested tokens will be immediately available to you, with no further restrictions on transfer or sale. Additional tokens earned as a reward for staking or delegating are not subject to any restrictions.
