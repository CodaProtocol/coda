**Coda Genesis Program**  

**Program Details**

1. All tokens distributed under the Genesis program (from Cohort 2 onwards*) will be subject to a 4 year vesting period starting at mainnet launch. During the vesting period, you must participate as a block producer, by staking or delegating all of your unvested tokens. **If you stop staking or delegating at any time during the vesting period, you risk forfeiting all unvested tokens.** 
2. 25% of your tokens will vest on the one year anniversary of mainnet launch, with the remaining tokens vesting in equal monthly tranches over the following three years. Additional tokens earned as a reward for staking or delegating are not subject to any restrictions.

    *Note: Cohort 1 has a 1-year staking period

4. To become a Genesis founding member, you must complete the application, pass KYC checks and provide all required documentation, and agree to the Terms and Conditions.

**Terms and Conditions**



1. All tokens distributed under the Genesis program, for Cohort 2 and all following Cohorts, will be subject to a 4 year vesting period commencing on the day of Coda Protocol’s mainnet genesis block (“Vesting Period”). 
2. **IF YOU DO NOT STAKE OR DELEGATE ALL UNVESTED TOKENS FOR THE DURATION OF THE VESTING PERIOD THEN YOU RISK FORFEITING ANY UNVESTED TOKENS.**
3. One-quarter of your tokens from the Genesis program will vest on the first anniversary of mainnet launch. The remaining tokens will vest in equal monthly tranches over the following three years. 
4. Forfeiture of tokens be enforced automatically at the protocol level. This means that if you fail to stake or delegate at any time during the Vesting Period, the protocol will automatically enforce the forfeiture of all of your unvested tokens, which will be irreversible and not subject to dispute. O(1) Labs may not be able to prevent forfeiture from being enforced by the protocol and will not compensate you in the event that your tokens are forfeited.
5. Vested tokens will be immediately available to you, with no further restrictions on transfer or sale. Additional tokens earned as a reward for staking or delegating are not subject to any restrictions.
6. When identifying participants who may qualify as Members, the following contributions may be taken into account: being a testnet participant, creating documentation, including explanatory documents and blog posts, stress-testing the protocol, creating tooling for the protocol or applications that use the protocol, translating documentation into different languages, providing help and support to users and other participants, including creating and moderating chats, forums, social media channels and meetups, and reporting bugs and issues in the protocol.
7. Coda Protocol Testnet points may be taken into consideration when determining whether you qualify as a Member. However, testnet points do not guarantee eligibility for the Program or receipt of any benefits, and are not redeemable for cash or other value.Testnet points are an indication of the participant’s technical competence and commitment to support the protocol. For example, a participant with more testnet points is more likely to have the know-how to be a Block Producer on Coda Protocol mainnet, or to detect and report bugs effectively. However, O(1) Labs will not make any discretionary judgment about the value of any participant’s contributions.
8. No distributions will be made before the mainnet launch of Coda Protocol. You are not guaranteed to receive a distribution until the time that you actually receive coda tokens and fully satisfy the vesting requirements. 
9. All Members who receive a distribution will receive the same amount of coda tokens. O(1) Labs will not have discretion to allocate more or fewer tokens to any participant.
10. All distributions are subject to vesting as follows. These requirements will be enforced at the protocol level.
11. If you receive a distribution, you must stake or delegate all of your unvested tokens for a continuous period of four years commencing on the day of Coda Protocol’s mainnet genesis block (“Vesting Period”). 
12. **If you fail to stake all of your unvested tokens, you may forfeit all of your unvested tokens.**
13. During the Vesting Period, forfeiture will be enforced automatically at the protocol level. This means that if you fail to meet the staking requirement, Coda Protocol will automatically enforce the forfeiture of your tokens, which will be irreversible and not subject to dispute. O(1) Labs will not be able to prevent forfeiture from being enforced by Coda Protocol and will not compensate you in the event that your tokens are forfeited. 
14. At the end of the one year anniversary of the genesis block, one-quarter of your coda tokens will vest and be fully released. Those tokens will be immediately available to you, with no further restrictions on transfer or sale. The remaining three quarters of the tokens will vest in equal tranches at the end of each month over the following three years.
15. During the Vesting Period: 
    1. your full entitlement of tokens will be available for staking or delegating; and

You and we agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to the Program or these Terms, including, without limitation, federal and state statutory claims, common law claims, and those based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, shall be resolved through binding arbitration, on an individual basis. Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, you may elect to pursue your claim in your local small claims court rather than through arbitration so long as your matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual (non-class and non-representative) basis. Arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes. This agreement to arbitrate includes, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement. All such matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court or judge. 
26. The place of arbitration shall be in San Francisco, California. The language of arbitration shall be English. The arbitral award shall be final and binding upon both parties.

THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS OR ENGAGE IN ANY CLASS ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION 
27. These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between O(1) Labs and you regarding the Program, and the Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between O(1) Labs and you. To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between these Terms and any other documents or materials provided by O(1) Labs, these Terms prevail. If any provision of the Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of the Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer the Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without O(1) Labs’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer the Terms, without such consent, will be null and void. O(1) Labs may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns. 
28. O(1) Labs’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of O(1) Labs. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. 
29. O(1) Labs may, with or without prior notice and at any time, modify or terminate, temporarily or permanently, any part or all of the Program, except for distributions of coda that have been confirmed in the genesis block. Once distributions have been confirmed at the protocol level, neither O(1) Labs nor any other party has the ability to cancel or change them. Any notices or other communications provided by O(1) Labs under the Terms, including those regarding modifications to the Terms, will be posted on this page.
