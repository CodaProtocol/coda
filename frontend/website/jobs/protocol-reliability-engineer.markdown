Mainstream cryptocurrencies handle large amounts of value exchange each day. As a result, rigorous security practices, thorough testing, and rock-solid infrastructure are of paramount importance. We're seeking a protocol reliability engineer who wants to use modern tools like Terraform, Kubernetes, and Docker to develop the core tooling we use to test, monitor, secure, and stabilize our growing cryptocurrency network.

We’re hiring engineers to work on a bunch of exciting projects, including:

- Advancing our testing environment that can simulate network performance with thousands of machines across variable network conditions
- Creating the core machine images we use to streamline onboarding new network nodes
- Developing sophisticated diagnostic systems that continuously monitor network performance and provide visibility into network health
- Manage and grow testnets
- Designing robust, self-healing systems that ensure the health and stability of a fledgling cryptocurrency network under intense network loads or highly adversarial environments

No prior cryptocurrency experience is necessary.

This is a chance to join a small, collaborative team and gain a ton of independence while working on fascinating cross-disciplinary problems in computing. We also offer competitive compensation both in salary and equity as well as top-of-the-market benefits.
