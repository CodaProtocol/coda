Help us build the backend for accessible, usable, delightful products on top of the Coda Cryptocurrency Protocol! Cryptocurrency is a domain where correctness really counts. As such, a cornerstone of our approach is a focus on building reliable software through the use of statically-typed functional programming languages. This is reflected in our OCaml codebase and style of structuring code around DSLs.

 While it's hard to say exactly what we'll work on given that we are such an early-stage startup, we expect projects to include:

- Developer tools and SDKs on top of Coda
- The command-line-interface for the Coda client and daemon
- Exposing core functionality via our GraphQL API
- Working on the core networking, cryptography, and reliability aspects of the protocol

## Requirements

- Internship(s) or 1+ years engineering experience
    - Bonus: Worked on a product team
- Willingness to work on-site in a San Francisco based office
- Experience with ReasonML, OCaml, Haskell, or Rust or some other similar strong statically typed programming language

## Grab Bag (at least one of the following)

- Experience working on multiple collaborative projects with a product team containing at least one additional developer (or larger team-based projects at university or a bootcamp program).
- Exposure to working with cryptocurrencies
- Early stage startup experience
- Experience with contributing to Open Source
- Expertise in one of: Functional programming, security, distributed systems
