## About us

O(1) Labs is aiming to develop the first cryptocurrency protocol that can deliver on the promise of supporting real-world applications and
widespread use. Our team is based in San Francisco, and we are funded by top investors (including Polychain, Metastable, Max Levchin, and Naval
Ravikant).

We’re bringing Coda Protocol to market, a cryptocurrency that
compresses the blockchain from hundreds of gigabytes down to the size of a few tweets. It can scale to thousands of transactions per second and
millions of users while remaining decentralized enough for cellphones to be fully verifying nodes.

This is a chance to join a small, collaborative team and have a ton
of independence while working on fascinating cross-disciplinary problems that span cryptography, engineering, product design, economics, and
sociology. We offer competitive compensation both in salary and
equity as well as top-of-the-market benefits.

If you’d be interested in talking further, please get in touch by
sending an email with your resume, link to your portfolio, and the
subject “Visual Design Applicant” to [jobs@o1labs.org](mailto:jobs@o1labs.org?subject=%22Senior%20Designer%20Applicant%22). A portfolio is required to be considered for this role.

We are committed to building a diverse, inclusive company. People of
color, LGBTQ individuals, women, and people with disabilities are
strongly encouraged to apply.
