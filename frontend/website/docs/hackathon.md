## GraphQL Workshop

We will be hosting the GraphQL workshop at 10pm PST on Friday, 11/1.

## Hackathon Challenges

### Painting with Coda
Build the coolest visualization on top of the [Coda GraphQL API](https://codaprotocol.com/docs/developers/graphql-api/). 

Visualizations will be judged on the following criteria:

- Project must use data from the Coda GraphQL API
- Uniqueness of visualization
- Design & UI
- Efficiency of implementation

Here are some example project ideas we'd *love* to see: 

- Node Dashboard (Monitor Your Node)
  - Peer Map
- Block Visualization w/ slots (like [this](https://connerswann.me/2019/09/weekend-project-coda-blockchain.html) but better)
- TPS Meter
  - Count new blocks as they come in, compare with slot + epoch + timestamp 
- Calculate Fee Transfer Waste 
- Block Explorer 
- Tools for Node Operators

There is a total of $2500 in prizes to be won.

### Connect to the Testnet
Connect to the [Coda testnet](https://codaprotocol.com/testnet.html) and stop by our booth for a small prize. Read the [Getting Started](https://codaprotocol.com/docs/getting-started/) docs here.

Requirements for synchronizing to the network:

- Connect a node to the live network
- Successfully receive funds from the faucet
- Send a transaction to the echo bot
- Show us at our booth
