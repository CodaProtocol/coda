#### Using MkDocs

The Coda Documentation site uses MkDocs, which is a simple markdown based documentation generator. `mkdocs.yaml` contains all the configuration details and the `docs` folder contains the documentation source files. 

To run the dev server and test out changes, simply run `yarn dev` from the website root folder.

Visit `localhost:8000` in your browser to see the output of the dev server.
