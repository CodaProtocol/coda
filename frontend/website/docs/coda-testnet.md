# Hello Coda

Coda's public testnet beta `Hello Coda` is now live! This means that anyone can download the Coda daemon and connect to other peers in the network. You can send and receive coda, participate in consensus, and help compress the blockchain by generating SNARKs!

Join the [Coda server on Discord](http://bit.ly/CodaDiscord) to connect with the community, get support, and learn about how you can participate in weekly challenges for Testnet Points[\*](#disclaimer). Check out the [Testnet Leaderboard](#leaderboard) to see who is winning this week's challenges.

## Testnet Points

The goal of Testnet Points[\*](#disclaimer) is to recognize Coda community members who are actively involved in the network. There will be regular challenges to make it fun, interesting, and foster some friendly competition! Points can be won in several ways like being first to complete a challenge, contributing code to Coda, or being an excellent community member and helping others out.

The current challenges are:

**Challenge #1: Connect to Testnet** - 1000 pts for anyone who sends a transaction to the [echo service](/docs/my-first-transaction/#make-a-payment)
BONUS: An additional 2000 pts to the first person to complete the challenge, and an additional 1000 points to the second person to complete the challenge.

**Challenge #2: Community Helper** - 300 pts are awarded to anyone who helps another member of the community. This could include answering a question, helping them navigate the docs, and generally giving support and encouragement for those trying hard to get involved. We can only award points for what we see, so make sure you’re doing it in one of the official testnet channels so everyone can learn! 

**Challenge #3: Join Discord** - 100 pts awarded for introducing yourself in the #testnet-general channel. Name, location and what you’re excited about are all good things to share in order to get the points!
