The GUI Wallet is the easiest way to connect to the Coda network and run a node. You can use the wallet to send transactions, check your funds, stake coda, and create zk-SNARKs to compress transactions.

## Installation

You'll need to make sure TCP ports 8302 and 8303 are open on your router. You can check out our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/) guide for more details.
