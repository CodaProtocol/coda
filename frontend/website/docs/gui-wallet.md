The GUI Wallet is the easiest way to connect to the Coda network and run a node. You can use the wallet to send transactions, check your funds, stake coda, and create zk-SNARKs to compress transactions.

## Installation

Download the latest build [here](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wallet.o1test.net/branch/develop/wallet.dmg).

### MacOS
Open the DMG file and drag the wallet into your Applications folder

### Linux
Currently we only officially support MacOS.

## Setup

When you open the Wallet for the first time you'll be guided through a few steps to create an account and begin using Coda. If you get stuck on anything head over to the Discord and ask for help.
