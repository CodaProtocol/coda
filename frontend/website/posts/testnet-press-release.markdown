**Highlights:**

- O(1) Labs has formed a Testnet Advisory Board to advance the development of Coda Protocol
- Zaki Manian and Luke Youngblood will join the board as technical advisors
- Manian and Youngblood, two of the most respected individuals in the Proof of Stake community, will advise the O(1) Labs team as they advanced towards a mainnet candidate for Coda Protocol. They have prior experience as principal contributors to the Cosmos and Tezos testnet, respectively.
- The Coda Protocol Public Testnet [Beta] was released on July 24, 2019 and has achieved a number of firsts in the blockchain industry which will greatly reduce the tradeoff between decentralization and scale.

San Francisco, CA - [O(1) Labs](https://o1labs.org/), the software development company building [Coda Protocol](https://codaprotocol.com/), announced that it has established a Testnet Advisory Board, and will welcome two industry leaders, Zaki Manian and Luke Youngblood, as technical advisors.

O(1) Labs also announced the start of the next phase of Coda Protocol’s testnet in beta, starting with release 2.1, which will allow users to operate nodes on a cryptocurrency network utilizing their succinct blockchain technology.

Coda Protocol, the first succinct blockchain that can remain decentralized at scale, has seen rapid progression and advanced the state-of-the-art in significant ways. Some of Coda’s breakthroughs include:

- Usage of recursive zk-SNARKs to facilitate a succinct blockchain
- Production implementation of a modified Ouroboros Proof of Stake consensus algorithm
- Development of [snarky](https://github.com/o1-labs/snarky), an OCaml DSL for writing zk-SNARKs
- First marketplace for zk-SNARK proofs, the ‘SNARKetplace’

The Testnet Advisory Board is in keeping with the collaborative nature of the blockchain industry. According to Emre Tekisalp, Director of Business Development at O(1) Labs, ‘We’re seeing a cambrian explosion of open source and peer-to-peer networks. As the industry iterates on what will become mission critical infrastructure for the internet, it’s imperative that we collaborate.’

Zaki Manian is Head of Research at [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/), which pioneered a new standard in the way Proof of Stake networks are launched with the first adversarial, incentivized testnet, ‘Game of Stakes’ on the Cosmos network. He is also the co-founder of [iqlusion](https://www.iqlusion.io/?gclid=CjwKCAjwq4fsBRBnEiwANTahcKxTKEAMAPQPoDBlP3U6P3_PwlWDeVETyQhDPv0r0k490psfI_v6OxoChggQAvD_BwE), which provides state-of-the-art secure infrastructure for next generation blockchain networks. According to Manian, ‘Coda Protocol's public testnets and demonstration of succinct blockchains are phenomenal technical achievements. The technology has profound implications for scalability and interoperability."

Luke Youngblood is the founder and CEO of [Blockscale](https://blockscale.net/), an early pioneer of blockchain and crypto technologies. In 2018, he helped launch the [Tezos](https://tezos.com/) network by creating the staking infrastructure for the [Tezos Foundation](https://tezos.foundation/), becoming the largest decentralized proof of stake validator in the world overnight. "I'm thrilled to join Coda Protocol as a testnet advisor. Developers have built some amazing decentralized apps, but to date, these apps have always required some centralized infrastructure. I'm excited about the potential of Coda to enable developers to build truly decentralized apps."

‘We are thrilled to welcome Zaki and Luke, both of whom bring a wealth of expertise and are well respected in the industry, into our community. The Testnet Advisory Board will allow us to iterate even more quickly towards a mainnet candidate,’ said Evan Shapiro, co-founder and CEO at O(1) Labs.
