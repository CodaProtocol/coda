      SNARK "zk_state_valid" proving that, for new_state:
        - all old values came from a state with valid proof
        - ledger_proof proves a valid sequence of transactions moved the ledger from state.body.ledger_hash to new_ledger_hash
        - length is one greater than the old length
        - "incr_epoch" computed correctly
        - if incr_epoch, epoch_ledger_hash is state.next_epoch_ledger_hash, else state.epoch_ledger_hash
        - if slot# < global.epoch_ledger_hash_cutoff, next_epoch_ledger_hash is new_ledger_hash, else state.next_epoch_ledger_hash
        - epoch_randomness computed correctly (and if incr_epoch, there was a next_epoch_randomness to unpack)
        - next_epoch_randomness computed correctly
        - next_epoch_randomness was signed by a sufficient number of members of the epoch
        - slot# is greater than the old slot#
        - epoch# >= state.epoch#
        - prev_state_hash is hash(state)
        - signature is the signature of hash(state) with self_private_key
        - self_private_key corresponds to a public_key that matches the public_key computed as winner for slot#, epoch# under global.epoch_seed, state.epoch_ledger_hash, and state.epoch_randomness
